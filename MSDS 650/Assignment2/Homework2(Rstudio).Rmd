## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Exercise 1
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/karim/Downloads")
ab_test <- read.csv("productivity_data.csv")
head(ab_test)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ab_test$group <- factor(ab_test$group, levels = c("training", "teamwork"))

ggplot(ab_test, aes(x = productivity)) + 
    geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", col = "black", bins = 13) +
    facet_wrap(~ group, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
    labs(x = "Productivity (Tasks Completed Per Day)", y = "Frequency") + 
    theme_classic()
```
```{r}
library(car)
```

```{r}
tapply(ab_test$productivity, ab_test$group, sd)
```

```{r}
tapply(ab_test$productivity, ab_test$group, length)
```
##B.
```{r}
leveneTest(data = ab_test, productivity ~ group)
```
```{r}
t.test(productivity ~ group, data = ab_test, var.equal = TRUE)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##D.
```{r}
table <- data.frame(satisfied= c(35,41), unsatisifed = c(23,16), row.names = c("male","female"))
table
```
```{r}
chisq.test(table)
```
