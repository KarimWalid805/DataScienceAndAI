MSDS680 - Machine learning

Emphasizes on the use of data in the field of Machine Learning (ML), examining both theory and software implementation of models, methods and learning algorithms. Topics span over different ML paradigms, supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised and reinforcement learning. It starts with the basics of the Artificial Neuron and extends up to Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Deep Learning methods, with source code provided for example solutions on tasks that use diverse types of data. Additionally, classic ML approaches for classification and clustering (Bayesian, k-NN, Decision Trees, k-Means) are investigated and compared using proper performance metrics, according to a quantitative evaluation assessment strategy. Prerequisite(s): MSDS 650. The course covers the following topics:
 1. Artificial neurons and activation functions: Perceptron (threshold), Adaline (linear),Non-Linear (sigmoidal/rectifiers). The reference MLP neural network.
 2. Fully Connected (Dense) Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
3. Stochastic Gradient Descend (SGD) with error backpropagation. 
4. Multiclass Classification with the Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) loss function. 
5. Deep Learning: Normalization layers, residual skip connections, dropout layers. 
6. Binary Classification with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the Kernel Trick. 
7. Quantitative Evaluation: Metrics / Confusion Matrix / ROC Curve. 
8. Other Classification Methods: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)/Na√Øve Bayes. 
9. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs): Bayesian Networks (BNs). 
10. Decision Trees (DT): C4.5 Algorithm DT learning with the Information Gain (IG) goodness function. Bagging and Boosting, Random Forests. 
11. Unsupervised Clustering with k-Means and the generalized Minkowski DistanceHierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). 
12. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. Deep Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
